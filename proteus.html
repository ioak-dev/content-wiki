                    <p>It has never been so easy to do Json transformation in Java. Proteus is a library that can be used to transform a JSON data from one structure to another, using defined templates. It can be added to any existing java project with no effort.</p>
                    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <ul><li>Get an instance of proteus client and start transforming JSONs</li></ul>
                    <div class="snippet">
                            <p>
                                // get an instance of proteus
                                </br>                            
                                ProteusClient proteus = ProteusClient.getInstance();
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                // start executing commands on proteus client using one of several methods exposed
                                </br>
                                output_jsonobject = proteus.transform(input_jsonobject, template);
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                List<output_jsonobject> = proteus.transform(List<input_jsonobject>, template);
                                </br>
                                output_jsonarray = proteus.transform(input_jsonarray, template);
                            </p>
                    </div>
                    <ul><li>You can play with Example.java to see the transformation in action (for the included example Json input and templates)</li></ul>
                    
                    <h2>Features</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zero configuration. You can be up and running with this API in no time.</li>
                        <li>Easy and intuitive templates in Json format.</li>
                        <li>You can now do Json transformation of a document to more than one structure, by specifying multiple templates.</li>
                        <li>Supports Json transformation of multiple documents / Json array of documents in a single go.</li>
                        <li>Handles any level of nested array / document structure. You don’t need to worry about the number of elements at each node. Everything is taken care of. You no longer need to specify index positions to access array elements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="snippet">
                        <p>
                                {
                                    "First Name": "First Name",
                                    "Last Name": "Last Name",
                                    "Address": {
                                        "Street": "Address",
                                        "City": "City",
                                        "Country": "Country",
                                        "District": "District"
                                    },
                                    "Rentals": "_asSet(Rentals.Film Title AS Film Title,Rentals.Payments AS Payments)"
                                }
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Defining a template is as simple as creating a plain json text/object containing the key mappings. Above is a sample template and the details are explained below</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Elements can be nested to any level</li>
                        <li>Actual values that will be substitued for a given key, is defined as the value. this key is the actual element in the input json to be transformed. Values in input json can be represented using dot for each lower level</li>
                        <li>asSet is a keyword to group more than one elements together. This is needed when the resulting values are array. In the example above, Rentals field will have a json array as result with the included json object having fields film title, and payments. (Note: for asSet to work, the included fields should all return the exact same number of items for a given row. This is a reasonable and obvious business use case scenario)</li>
                        <li>Setup and execute the included example project to see it in action</li>
                        <li>AS is a keyword to give alias for theelements in sub json document. It is optional. If an explicit alias is omitted, last element key will be used by default. Play with the included examples</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>About the Codename</h2>
                    <p>Proteus was a primordial deity in Greek mythology, protector of the seas, rivers and other bodies of water. He is versatile, mutable and capable of assuming many different forms. Because Proteus could assume whatever shape he pleased, he came to be regarded by some as a symbol of the original matter from which the world was created. The word protean, one meaning of which is “changeable in shape or form,” is derived from Proteus.</p>
